/** @brief Class implementing the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) superpixels
algorithm described in @cite Achanta2012.

SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) clusters pixels using pixel channels and image plane space
to efficiently generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The simplicity of approach makes it
extremely easy to use a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels and the efficiency of
the algorithm makes it very practical.
Several optimizations are available for SLIC class:
SLICO stands for "Zero parameter SLIC" and it is an optimization of baseline SLIC described in @cite Achanta2012.
MSLIC stands for "Manifold SLIC" and it is an optimization of baseline SLIC described in @cite Liu_2017_IEEE.

/** @brief Initialize a SuperpixelSLIC object

@param image Image to segment
@param algorithm Chooses the algorithm variant to use:
SLIC segments image using a desired region_size, and in addition SLICO will optimize using adaptive compactness factor,
while MSLIC will optimize using manifold methods resulting in more content-sensitive superpixels.
@param region_size Chooses an average superpixel size measured in pixels
@param ruler Chooses the enforcement of superpixel smoothness factor of superpixel

The function initializes a SuperpixelSLIC object for the input image. It sets the parameters of choosed
superpixel algorithm, which are: region_size and ruler. It preallocate some buffers for future
computing iterations over the given image. For enanched results it is recommended for color images to
preprocess image with little gaussian blur using a small 3 x 3 kernel and additional conversion into
CieLAB color space. An example of SLIC versus SLICO and MSLIC is ilustrated in the following picture.
